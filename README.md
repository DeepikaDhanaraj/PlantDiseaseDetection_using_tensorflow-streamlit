## PlantDiseaseDection
Develop a plant disease detection system using TensorFlow and Streamlit to accurately identify various diseases affecting plants from images. The system should efficiently classify images of plant leaves as healthy or diseased,The goal is to empower farmers and agricultural stakeholders with a user-friendly tool for early detection and management of plant diseases, ultimately enhancing crop productivity and reducing agricultural losses.
